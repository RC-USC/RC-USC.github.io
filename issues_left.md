# International students / non-US citizen
Issues mentioned in this [interview](https://www.tempestmag.org/2023/12/graduate-student-workers-at-usc-make-gains-in-first-ever-union-contract/)

>We wanted better support for incoming international students, since for many of them, it was their first time living in a foreign country. But we were told that many of our demands cannot be bargained for, since the incoming students are not in a union yet. We still managed to add some basic demands into the initial proposal, like asking the university to provide more specialized workshops for international students. But the bargaining team later dropped it, saying that the union can provide these things.

>We also wanted better visa-related document processing. The Office of International Services (OIS) in charge of our immigration documentation has been understaffed, and we thought about asking USC to provide more resources for this office. But we were told that is not bargainable. We then tried to suggest including language ensuring that the administration would cover financial costs for any mistakes in our visa documents. But the bargaining team also later dropped this, saying that this would already be protected and that we could fill grievances later, providing an example from UC San Francisco. But when we tried to clarify whether the university would cover our financial loss if they made a mistake in our documents (leading to issues like missing our paychecks), the bargaining team did not give us a clear answer. We did get the university to commit to putting $10,000 a year into a fund to assist with international students’ visa issues. Personally, I think this is different from our initial goal, which is to get the university to commit to not offloading costs onto international students for its own errors—no matter the cost. **And this "solution" is much cheaper than hiring even one more staff in the OIS.**
