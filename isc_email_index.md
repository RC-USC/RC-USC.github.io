title: GSWOC International Student Committee email backup
---
In the last 10 years (2012-2022), 50~52% percent of enrolled PhD students are international, except 2020, only 49% due to covid. (the most recent data published on [USC website](https://graduateschool.usc.edu/about-us/phd-program-characteristics/))

In Spring 2022, a group of international students realized that they are an important part of our campus but usually get marginalized in decision making.
They believe that international students should organize themself to have their voice in our union and in campus activities. So, they started the **GSWOC International Student Committee** with the goal of organizing and advocating for international students. 
The committee is a place for international students to discuss any issues related to their lives and organize to make things better. They organized events for international students to ask questions about the union; and events for discussions about things people want to change via bargaining.

**In Nov 2023, after conflict, bargaining team took over the international student committee email list and announce the committee no longer exists.** After the bargaining finished, international student committee webpage was taken down from union website. ([Webpage archive](

People from other unions have reached out to learn their experience of organizing international students. Here is the email export. (There have been many important off-email-list private discussion, which they are happy to discuss face to face.)
