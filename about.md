# Who are we?
We are organizers in GSWOC who believe in:
* Democratic & transparent union.
* Rank-and-file driven union
* Social-justice unionism

# What are our goals?
<!-- We welcome people to campaign on issues related to their life on our platform. -->

<!-- # Why independent mailing list and chat group?
Bargaining team refused to send out our email discussing proposals, and deleted our message on slack. We realized that we need an independent platform to make the change happen. -->
