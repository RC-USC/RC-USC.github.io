# Who are we?
We are organizers in GSWOC who believe in:
* Democratic & transparent union
* [Rank-and-file driven union](https://labornotes.org/blogs/2022/09/rank-and-file-power-essential-rebuilding-labor-movement)
* [Social-justice unionism](https://socialistworker.org/2015/05/18/the-meaning-of-social-justice-unionism)

# What are our goals?
**Transparent & Democratic Decision Making**

We want more union members to join the decision-making process of anything related to themselves.
We aim to increase the transparency and accessibility of the decision-making process.

**Support marginalized workers**

* **Realize promises.** In 2023, the bargaining team responded to many demands of International students by saying, "It is difficult to bargain, we can fight for it as a union after this bargaining", and "We can provide this as a union‚Äù. We listed those promises [here](https://rc-usc.github.io/issues_left).

* **Empower marginalized workers.** When discussing about bargaining for better healthcare, people get into conversations like, "better wage can benefit everyone", thus healthcare may be put into lower priority; When asking bargaining team why things related to International students were dropped, the answer was "to win as many core demands as possible". We want marginalized workers to be empowered and their demands to be kept at the bargaining table till the last minute. 

**Change our union culture**
* **Create a safe community.** Many people, especially International students, are not willing to tell organizers what they think and how they feel. We want to create a safe organizing space for our people and all our organizers to truly listen. So we can really hear people.
* **Bottom-up and critical-thinking.** In 2023, organizers at department-level were given tasks by bargaining team / steering committee in a top-down way. Many of our organizers collect signature like KPI (Key Performance Indicator), just ask people to sign on things with little explaination.
