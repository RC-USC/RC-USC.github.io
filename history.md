# International student
In spring 2019, a few Chinese international GSW started to mobilize Chinese students to form a union. In spring 2022, they started the GSWOC international student committee with student from other countries, with the goal to organize and advocate for international students. The committee is a place for international students to discuss any issues related to their life and organize to make things better. They organized events for international students to ask questions about the union; and events for discussions about things people want to change via bargaining.

During the bargaining, some of them realized a democratic & transparent union, and social-justice unionism is important for both advocating rights for marginalized worker and issues that impact everyone,.e.g. wage. Especially after connecting with other groups and experencing intersection of identities, they began to build coalition and started this caucus.

# Social-justice unionism in GSWOC

# GSWOC history
GSWOC was founded in 2016 by doctoral students at USC. Believing in recognizing the work we do as labor, and the need for collective bargaining power--which Graduate Student Government (GSG) does not have--graduate students began a campaign to form a union. Despite USC’s hostility to unionization, our campaign has put important pressure on university administrators. One of GSWOC’s earliest priorities was to address the dramatic discrepancies in doctoral stipends. In 2016, USC doctoral student employees typically earned an annual salary between $21K and $26.5K,  at stipend rates which hadn’t been adjusted for inflation in nearly a decade. In early 2017, USC announced that all doctoral stipends would be raised to a universal baseline of $26K that Fall  and then $30K in 2018.

Between 2016 and 2018 GSWOC worked with labor union SEIU 721 as part of their coalitional campaign between community members and university workers “USC Forward.” GSWOC responded to the revelation of George Tyndall’s systemic and university-sanctioned sexual assaults by creating coalitional spaces with GSG and I Am Student X to challenge sexual violence on campus. In the summer of 2020, amidst growing fears about the coronavirus pandemic, GSWOC co-authored a petition with the USC GSG requesting a universal one-year funding extension for doctoral students. GSWOC also played a part in the successful collective pressure put on the administration to pay graduate Assistant Lecturers in the Writing Program for their summer training. In the Fall of 2020 GSWOC voted to make UAW our parent union.
