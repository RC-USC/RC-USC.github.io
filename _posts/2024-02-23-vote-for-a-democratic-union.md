## Update
We passed 3 out of 10 amendments. Just want to cheer people up. It is very hard to change an organization. 
It may take years of effort, but it is possible. Some reform caucuses have successfully changed their unions. 
Also, even if we failed any single campaign, we still made our voice heard and pushed union culture to a positive direction. We planted seeds in people's minds.
Also, I'm sure some current union leaders won't take it personal.
