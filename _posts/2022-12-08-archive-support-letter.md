As international graduate student workers paid by stipends, we are all experiencing increased financial pressure from inflation and the high cost of living in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, international graduate students frequently face  verbal abuse from advisers, unbearable workloads, and huge uncertainty with visas. By forming a union, we, as international student workers, have more power to negotiate with the USC administration for improvements and protections. 

作为一名在美国留学并获得学校薪水的留学生，相信您和我们一样都感受到了沉重的经济压力，通胀高企，在洛杉矶的生活开销日益高昂。同时，身为留学生，我们会出于文化差异和身份问题，在很多场合选择忍受不公，不敢发声，我们往往要面对导师更高更苛刻的要求，但却得不到应有的平等轮休待遇和尊重。这些巨大的生活工作压力和签证上的巨大不确定性时常难以承受。学生雇员工会的成立，将给与我们权力同USC谈判未来劳工合同条款，争取更好的薪酬待遇和更多的权益保护。

We also recognize that international students, depending on their different national origins and cultural backgrounds, are forced to contend with unique issues of racism, financial precarity especially in times of crisis, and feeling like outsiders in their day to day lives in the US. We aim to build a union that reflects all of our experiences and is representative of the diversity of international graduate students. Thus, we kindly invite you to join this process. We want your voice to be heard by the USC admin and your concerns to be addressed. Collectively, we will make USC a better place for everyone. If you would like to become more involved in building our union, please fill out this short google form.

我们明白，来自不同的地区和文化背景的留学生不得不面对自己独有的问题，比如种族歧视，经济困难，在美国的日常生活中，仿佛是一个局外人。我们希望建立一个能够理解所有人困难和处境的工会，能够代表留学生们不同的需求。
因此，我们真诚的邀请你参与进来。留学生群体人数颇多但声量不大，我们希望你的需求被USC校方听到，希望你的困难和留学历程得到实质性的改善。我们希望与你一同将 USC 变得更好。如果你想更多的参与工会的组建，欢迎填写这个 Google form 。

Once we have a union, we will elect a bargaining team, democratically determine bargaining demands, negotiate with USC for a new contract, and eventually the contract will be voted on by all GSWs in USC. After a contract is ratified by voting, we may pay dues, which are 1.44%. In union contracts at other academic institutions, wage and benefit increases are significantly more than the amount of dues.

工会成立之后，我们会选举出一个协商小组，民主的确定谈判要求，以同USC谈判新的合同，并最终由全部硕博学生雇员投票签订新的协议。一旦新的协议签订，您需要上交每月工资的1.44%作为会费。在其他学校工会获得的新合同中，薪资涨幅远超上交的会费。


无论是你是留学生还是美国学生，参与工会的权力同样受政府法律保护，并且不会影响您的签证。感谢您的支持和理解！如果您还有疑问，您可以直接回复本邮件或者访问我们为留学生建立的网页以了解更多信息和如何参与。

Whether you are an international or domestic student worker, your right to participate in a union is legally protected by the government and it won’t affect your visa. We really appreciate your support and understanding. If you have questions, please don’t hesitate to respond to this email or visit our webpage for international students for more information and how to get involved. 

一个人是渺小的，但是团结起来的力量是巨大的！

In solidarity,
