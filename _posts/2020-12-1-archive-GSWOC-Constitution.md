## Constitution of USC Graduate Student Worker Organizing Committee (v 1.5)

### 1 – PREAMBLE 

1.1 The USC Graduate Student Worker Organizing Committee (GSWOC) aims to form a democratic labor union representing graduate student workers employed by the University of Southern California. 

1.2 GSWOC members are USC graduate student workers who participate in the campaign for unionization on a volunteer basis. 

1.3 GSWOC upholds a Statement of Values that reflects our commitment to social justice unionism.

1.4 GSWOC receives organizational and financial support from its affiliated union local. 

### 2 – GRADUATE STUDENT WORKER ORGANIZING COMMITTEE 

2.1 GSWOC is the decision-making body of the campaign to unionize USC graduate student workers.

2.2 GSWOC members must a) be USC graduate student workers; b) must commit to a full one-year term of participation (terms begin in either August or January); c) must sign the GSWOC Statement of Values; and d) must take part in the work of one GSWOC subcommittee. 

2.3 All GSWOC members are voting members. Members who miss three consecutive GMMs or five GMMs in total during a single term of service thereby forfeit their membership and voting status.

2.4 GSWOC makes decisions at monthly General Membership Meetings (GMM) using GSWOC's Rules of Order - updated and maintained by the Internal Subcommittee. GMMs are convened with a quorum of 50% +1. Decisions not reached by unanimous vote are resolved by majority vote. 

2.5 GSWOC distributes the work of the unionization campaign through subcommittees. Subcommittees self-organize to convene meetings, document progress, and report to the general membership. Members may switch subcommittees by contacting a member of the Internal Subcommittee..

2.5.1 **Internal Subcommittee** (Recommended size: 2 members per term): schedules and announces GMMs; creates GMM agendas; recommends and upholds GSWOC’s Rules of Order; coordinates chairing and minute-taking responsibilities; maintains private internal archive of minutes, proposals, and other documents; manages internal email listserv; keeps a record of subcommittee assignments; coordinates vetting process and intake for new members; coordinates skills trainings and visioning meetings for GSWOC general membership. 

2.5.2 **Outreach Subcommittee** (Recommended size: as large as possible): organizes public info sessions, campaign actions and events; convenes meetings with prospective GSWOC members; coordinates campus tabling and events; works closely with the staff of our parent union assigned to support outreach efforts. 

2.5.3 **Research Subcommittee** (Recommended size: 3-5 members per term): proposes priority research for approval by the general membership; conducts research and compiles data; reports on research findings for GSWOC use; works closely with the research staff of our parent union.

2.5.4 **Communications Subcommittee** (Recommended size: 2-3 members per term): manages external mailing list; nominates and trains GSWOC media spokespersons; develops GSWOC media talking points; coordinates with sympathetic media to cover GSWOC events and actions; maintains the campaign’s public-facing online presence; coordinates production of promotional material; works closely with the communication staff of our parent union. 

2.5.5 **BIPOC Subcommittee** (Recommended size: as large as possible, restricted to individuals who identify as Black, Indigenous, or People of Color): currently composed of Black, Asian, Latinx, and Native American caucuses (with the addition of new caucuses as decided on by members) that meet both separately and jointly; develops political organization and political engagement for BIPOC across campus through a department-based “BIPOC Alliance” model; develops and proposes strategies and objectives for GSWOC campaigns as they emerge within BIPOC organizing.

2.6 In addition to required subcommittee work, GSWOC members are encouraged to participate in campus-wide, cross-campus and city coalitions. Official GSWOC representatives are approved by the general membership and must provide updates on coalition work at GMMs. Coalition involvement is voluntary but important for upholding GSWOC’s commitment to social justice unionism. 

2.7 GSWOC relationship to parent union: staff representatives of our affiliated parent union are non-voting members of GSWOC. These organizers attend GSWOC meetings in an advisory role.
