# Sep 15, 2022
Hi everyone,
As you may know, international students consist of half of our union.
We are planning to have an informal gathering to share our experience and discuss strategies for organizing international students. We will also talk about the unique challenges international students are facing and how we can address them through contract negotiations.

Please fill out this google form to show that you are interested and to indicate which days/times work for you. Location is to be determined, but it will be somewhere with food/drinks within walking distance of UPC. We are planning it at the week of the 26th.

Rob, Me and B will coordinate this event.
Thanks for your contribution to building our union.
Cheers,
R
