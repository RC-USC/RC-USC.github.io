GSWOC International Student Committee email back up
# Jun 7, 2023
Hello All,

R has come to our last couple of bargaining sessions and has been able to get some clarification on our article from Kavitha. [Here is a link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xd7NgTTY2IeYe60LEjS98PuP0gYz2QdqT0wNAWI5o50/edit?usp=sharing) to the document they wrote up. 

I have heard concerns and questions from many of you, but if anything else has come up please let me know.

We are introducing the article to USC admin on the 15th, and we are encouraging GSWs to attend. [Here is the link to RSVP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6rXwjqQLzWGqk6ZigkhWUBGUp4i0obRuB3TtA6Cz4J0d5uA/viewform).

Best,

J
