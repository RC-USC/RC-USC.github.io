Hi everyone,

Hope you are all well! I am reaching out to update you all that the letter to highlight international student workers' support for unionizing at USC is now ready for signatures. Would you all mind having a look at it and add your names as signatories if that seems okay?
Please feel free to circulate to your international peers and friends at USC as well. For those who may be available to translate it, please let me know!
