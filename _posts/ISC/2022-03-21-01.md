GSWOC International Student Committee email back up

# Mar 21, 2022
Hi everyone,

In the previous followup, this link was shared https://makingabetternyu.org/faq-for-international-students/
I think this is a good start point.

In addition to these question, I think this can be added:

How can I contribute to GSWOC?
* Share with your friends with our information [Insert link to our general FAQ/about page]
* Sign a authorization card
* Vote Yes for unionization

Please reply to share your ideas!

Best,

R
