GSWOC International Student Committee email back up
# Feb 28, 2023
Hi everyone,
As discussed in our previous meeting, we are planning to have an event after spring break. For our last event at Rock & Rally, we invited people who have been active in GSWOC. This time, we can reach out to more people.

So we will need more people to help organizing!
If you are interested, please add yourself to the public channel "international" on gswoc slack. You can join the slack here:

Other updates:

In the weekly steering committee meeting, it was mentioned we will have less OC meeting in the future.
Instead of OC meeting, there will be more townhall events open to general public.
Also, it was mentioned the scheduling and the meeting note of the steering committee will be transparent.  And welcome everyone interested in organizing to join.

Best,
R
