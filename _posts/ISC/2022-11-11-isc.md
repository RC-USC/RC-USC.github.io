GSWOC International Student Committee email back up
# Nov 11, 2022
Hi all,

Rob helped us draft an Op-Ed based on our previous discussion. The goal is to lay out the argument that the international GSW should support the union. We plan to put it on the GSWOC website and GSWOC social media platform. Here is the draft. Please leave your comment and feedback. Let's make the voice of international students be heard. 

Best
