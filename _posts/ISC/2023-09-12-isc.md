GSWOC International Student Committee email back up
# Sep 12, 2023
Hi everyone,
As you may have heard about the result of recent bargaining team election, two new international students, Sulyab and Yongqin, joined the bargaining team. Previously, the international student bargaining team member Sina has left the team, as he is about to graduate.
We are planning on another gathering at Rock and Reilly's for people to socialize and know each other.
Feel free to bring your friends and labmates who are interested.

Here is the when2meet, please fill it in so we can find a time when most people are available.

Also, our mass membership meeting will be on September 28, 5pm. We will discuss about how to escalate, give USC pressure, and win our demands. Please look out for email updates and try to join the meeting.
If you have the capacity for phone banking or on the ground organizing, you can sign up on this google sheet:

Have a good day!

Best,
