Hi everyone,

Hope folks have had a good spring break! I wanted to invite everyone to tomorrow’s Boba Hour at EEB 132 at 4pm. All international student workers are welcome to join and discuss the union bargaining process and demands related to you. If you’re planning to attend, please let us know so we know how many to expect! RSVP here.

Solidarity,
K
