GSWOC International Student Committee email back up
# Feb 19, 2023
Hi everyone,
Just in case you missed this, Carla is an international student unjustly fired by her department and facing deportation.

I believe this may be something commonly worried by international students.
And as a newly formed Union, I believe it is time for us to let other international students know and join this collective action.
I believe a successful collective action gonna let international students see and realize the power of union.

Her hearing with USC is set to be on Tuesday, February 21 starting at 10 am at the Student Union Building (STU) 301. And we will show up.
Please let your friends know it and try to join it.

I quote this from the petition:
The same day she was dismissed from the program she received an email from USC OIS asking for her plane tickets back to South America, if she didn't leave the US before the semester ended she was going to be deported.

Please read into this for more details: https://www.change.org/p/keep-carla-at-usc

Best,
