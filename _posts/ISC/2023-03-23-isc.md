Hi everyone,

Hope your week is going well!  I wanted to invite everyone to the Happy Hour today at Rock and Reilly's at 4pm. All international student workers are welcome to join and discuss the union bargaining process, and put forth any questions or concerns they may have in a safe and welcoming space. Looking forward to seeing you all there!

Best
K
