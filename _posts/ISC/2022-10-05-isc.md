Hi all,

At the international student gathering last week, we discussed problems that international students are facing and how we can address them in contract negotiation.

Here is a summary of what has been discussed:

If you want to add anything, please continue the discussion by replying to this post.

Many things mentioned in the document are not just for international students. 

Feel free to contribute your thoughts whether you are an international student or not.

Cheers,
