GSWOC International Student Committee email back up

# Jun 6, 2022
Hi Everyone,

Want to share the results so far from the international student survey that was sent out on Thursday. We received over 40 responses, which is not bad for a single email.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1728HowoMLbEIYeNVBiMjzSjubWWhxKcHIp4sTD3i9ik/edit?usp=sharing

Very striking to me is that around half of respondents "have experienced or witnessed different treatment seemingly due to immigration status or being an international student employee". 

In this google doc I removed names and contact information, however, there are a bunch of people that indicated they want to be added to the committee and we should follow up with them asap. Would someone be willing to work with me to do that?

Cheers,
Rob

Hi Rob,
I can help with sending emails to follow up.
I probably won't have time for individual zoom meeting though.

Best,
R
