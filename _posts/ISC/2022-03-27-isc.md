Hi all,

We will have another meeting this week. We'll talk about International student survey and more. Agenda and zoom link will be send out shortly. First I'd like to recheck everyone's availability for meeting, so that we might find a meeting time works for more people's schedules. Please fill out the when2meet https://www.when2meet.com/?xxx.
