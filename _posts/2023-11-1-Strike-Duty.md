For the strike duties required to get strike pay, Our staff mentioned UAW standard is 20 hours for higher education. But the bargaining team can decide how many hours are needed. 

## Higher education
At Columbia University, also affiliated with UAW, it was 10 hours per week. 
And in practice, they also counts the time people joining membership meetings, which helped to increase attendance a lot:

At the last UC strike, 20 hours was required, but the actual check-in and out isn’t strict. So a few hours less is okay. Also, the remote strike duties, like phone banking, were very limited, a few people can get assigned. There is no more requirement about hours during winter break.

But “20 hours” itself could discourage people from joining the strike. If in practice, 10+ hours is gonna be okay to get the strike pay, why not just say 10+ hours?

## Auto worker
For the current strike of big 3 auto workers with UAW.
Their picket line is different from higher education. They usually do 24/7 picket line.
Their hours can be very different. Most workers had about 6 hours a week during the current strike. But it is adjusted based on the number of people to keep up the 24/7 picket. There is a news report mentioning 4 hours.

Also, their pay is prorated:

> Each day of lost wages on strike counts for an eligible member to receive "one day’s Strike Assistance at the prorated daily amount," ($100 per day.) [source](https://www.freep.com/story/money/personal-finance/susan-tompor/2023/09/15/uaw-strike-pay-2023/70840390007/)


In summary, there is no perfect number that suits every place. The number of hours depends on many things, and it is a issue could be discussed. It doesn’t have to be the working hours:
* How many people do we have?
* How many hours a week do people usually work?
* How many hours a week do we want the picket line to be active?
* If we want it to be a show of our power, maybe organize fewer but bigger shift, each shift with as many people as possible.
* If we want it to be constant disruption, maybe spread out.
