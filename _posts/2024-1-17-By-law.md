# By-law discussion
Hi everyone,

We are planning a discussion about union by-law this Sunday, 21th at 2PM. Agenda and zoom link is here: https://bit.ly/bylaw-usc
We invited two international students from UC to talk about this [amendment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fEI944Op0crotDb0AGv_54orojXMP7C96H__JNwwHpM/edit) to their by-law and what problem it tried to solve. This is organized by rank and file union members, not an official union event.

We will also discuss other things for our by-law:
* Financial transparency: financial report at monthly membership meeting, posting annual financial report on union website, like [UAW4121](https://www.uaw4121.org/about/financial/) did.
* Using due to hiring union staff: We found one union write into by-law that, the union staff’s salary rate shouldn’t be higher than the top paid student worker. (See [article 20](https://www.uaw4121.org/about/bylaws/) of UAW4121)
* International student: we will discuss the demands failed to win and how to address. .e.g. For on-boarding support of incoming students, maybe we can allocate a budget in by-law. And also better representation of international students in bargaining.
* Future bargaining team election: there was some [controversy](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQIV46lZYrMpeNOJHxqIPPNfblaIPxdCkjZuEbM9RYjBzX_g/viewform) for the last election, let’s discuss how to make it better for the future ones.

For the international student committee, we will discuss preserving the legacy and how to continue organizing for international students with our capacity.
